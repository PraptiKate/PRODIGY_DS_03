# Task 3: Decision Tree Classifier for Bank Marketing

## Objective
In this task, I built a decision tree classifier to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a bank’s product or service, based on their demographic and behavioral data.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Bank Marketing Dataset
- **Link**: [Bank Marketing Dataset - UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)

## Approach
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handled missing data and performed feature encoding for categorical variables.
2. **Model Building**: Built a decision tree classifier to predict customer subscription.
3. **Evaluation**: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model’s performance.

## Key Insights
- Contact type and previous campaign outcomes were the most significant predictors of customer subscription.
- The decision tree model helped identify important features for targeted marketing.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Files
- **Bank_Marketing_DecisionTree.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook with the code for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Conclusion
This task demonstrated my ability to build a predictive model using a decision tree classifier, which is widely used in business decision-making and marketing strategies.
